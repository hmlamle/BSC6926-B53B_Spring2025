# BSC6926-B53B_Spring2025

I forked this repo from [my Lab's spring 2025 Hypervolumes workshop repository](https://github.com/SeascapeEcologyLab-workshops/BSC6926-B53B_Spring2025) and modified it for my use. I deleted all of the files that built their online website (because I don't need that stuff) and additionally made even more annotations on the code so that I can go back and ensure I'm understanding what is going on.
