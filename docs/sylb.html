<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="course-description-and-learning-outcome"><strong>Course description and learning outcome:</strong></h4>
<p>Ecosystem structure and function are complex due to ecological and physicochemical processes occurring across multiple spatiotemporal scales. Due to advances in computing and statistical programming, new multivariate tools incorporating multi-scalar ecosystem responses are becoming increasingly popular to characterize ecosystem conditions and stability. One such technique is hypervolume modelling, which is based on Hutchinson’s <em>n</em>-dimensional hypervolume concept that describes the ecological requirements for an individual, species, or population to persist in a location. Due to the geometrical nature of hypervolumes and the flexibility of defining variables as axes, the hypervolume concept has been adapted to other ecological questions and processes above the species level (e.g., communities, habitats). The diverse use of hypervolumes includes quantifying species and community niche space, quantifying the state, stability, and resilience of ecosystems following disturbance and restoration, and how functional diversity, life-history strategies, and habitat filtering of community assemblages vary across environmental and disturbance gradients. During the workshop, we will discuss papers and cases related to these topics, and demonstrate how to conduct these assessments in R. These case studies will be followed by a walkthrough of the data and R code used to conduct the hypervolume analyses. R scripts and markdown/quarto files will be provided to encourage students to conduct hypervolume analysis on their own data and promote comparative cross-system studies.</p>
<p>Hypervolume modelling is a multivariate tool that can be used to characterize ecosystem condition and stability. Multiple case studies using hypervolumes in coastal ecosystems with the data and R code used to conduct the analyses will be presented.</p>

<p><em>In-Person Sessions:</em> Lectures and hands-on programming/modeling exercises will be an integral part of the workshop’s learning experience; thus, most sessions will be based on face-to-face meetings to facilitate learning and assistance during the workshop sessions. In-person sessions will be offered only at BBC (MSB 113).</p>
<p><em>CANVAS:</em> We will upload workshop materials on CANVAS and communicate via CANVAS and email. We will announce any changes to the schedule one week or more in advance.</p>
<p><em>Office hours:</em> By appointment - We are constantly in/out of the office; thus, please send an email or talk to us after the workshop lectures to set up an office meeting.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="teaching"><strong>Teaching:</strong></h4>
<p>Lectures and R programming exercises will be part of each workshop session to introduce several topics on multidimensional and hypervolume-based niche analysis. The grade will be based on class participation (50%), manuscript contributions (25%), and final presentation (25%).</p>
</section>
<section id="grading" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="grading"><strong>Grading:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Class participation (Total 50 pts)</strong> will count for 50% of your final grade. Class attendance, participation in paper/topic discussions, including asking and answering questions, insightful comments and suggestions, and helping peers.</p>
<p><strong>Manuscript Contribution (Total 25 pts)</strong> will count for 25% of your grade. As part of the workshop, we will work together to prepare a manuscript on a research topic developed during the workshop. The grade will be based on your contribution to the manuscript, which will entail providing two or three paragraphs.</p>
<p><strong>Final Presentation (Total 25 pts)</strong> will count for 25% of your grade. Each student will receive a dataset that will contribute to the manuscript that we will prepare as a team. Thus, as part of this grade, you must present the results of a hypervolume analysis of the dataset assigned to you.</p>
</section>
<section id="rubric" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rubric"><strong>Rubric: </strong></h4>
<p>Grade scale is A (pass): 100-80; C (fail): &lt;79. This is a graduate-level workshop; thus, if you are taking this course, it is because you have a genuine interest in ecological learning and developing your academic career. For this reason, final grades will be pass (A) or no pass (C). Students who don’t commit to the work will be given a C or less. Students will be graded on their performance in the above areas ONLY. Future career plans will have ZERO influence on the grade you receive in this class. Incomplete grades will be considered only under extraordinary circumstances.</p>
</section>
<section id="make-up-policy" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="make-up-policy"><strong>Make-up policy: </strong></h4>
<p>I will provide make-up opportunities only when students present valid excuses (e.g., medical/family emergencies, COVID-19-related emergencies and precautions, major fieldwork trips, or conferences). Regardless of the reason, please contact me to identify alternative methods for completing course requirements, depending on the type of assignment missed and the severity of missed assignments. Below is a guideline of potential make-up scenarios/methods (Subject to change): - <em>Participation</em> – Due to the limited number of sessions, I will award a participation points for only one missed session with a validated and accepted excuse. - <em>Manuscript/Final Presentation</em> – Make-up alternatives only for medical (including COVID-19) emergencies. The make-up will consist of submitting the homework materials at a later date (e.g., 48-72 hours after the submission deadline), depending on the gravity of the emergency.</p>
